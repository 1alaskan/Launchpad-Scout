Context

I'm looking for a job, hopefully an interesting one. Okay, I'll apply. Cold applying went nowhere. Alright, I'll network to learn domain
knowledge, and if people are nice they might refer me. Well, people are very nice! That's the good news. Unfortunately, corporate 
referrals don't mean a whole lot in general. Furthermore, a lot of companies aren't hiring, wah wah wah, the job market is terrible, 
cry about it, then keep working the problem.

The problem is jobs aren't growing on trees and referrals don't mean much. The solution, find companies where referrals matter and that 
are actually growing. Startups. Cool! I live in the bay, I work obsessivly on things that capture my interest, I have a buiness and
tech background, I work well withouth mutch instruction or guidence, and I like doing all kinds of diffrent tasks, not just specilizing. 

Okay, time to find some startups and reach out! Turns out startup people are pretty busy and get blown up by cold outreach. 
Who knew? Shocking. So how do I find startups before they're already making noise?

There are tools like Harmonic.ai, Seedtable, Fundz, and Crunchbase Pro, but all of those are expensive and built for investors and 
sales teams. The signals they track are related, but not ideal for a job seeker.

So where's the startup pipeline tracker built for someone like me? There's WellFound and other startup job boards, but those tend to 
skew Series C and later, and the roles aren't exactly entry level friendly. As far as I can tell, a tool to find up and coming startups 
that are receptive to outreach, doesn't exist.

So I'm going to build it.

 Project Requirments 

1. Data Audit (done)
2. Cleaned Static data (done)
3. Cleaned Dyanamic data (inprogress)
4. Feature Egnineering 
5. ML Model 
    -Funding Classifyer
        -predict probailities that companies will rel funding in the next 90 days 
6. AWS pipline 
    -Dynamic scoring system 
7. Live Dashboard 


 OLD Project Goals  (this workflow rushed toward implemetnetion wihtouth exploring data sorucse first to cut down on integrating data that was completlty null)

1. Build an ETL pipeline
     — ingest and normalize data from WellFound, NewsAPI, LinkedIn job postings, and GitHub into a unified SQL database
2. Automate data collection 
    — schedule daily scraper runs via APScheduler so the pipeline stays fresh without manual effort
3. Engineer a momentum scoring model 
    — design a weighted scoring engine (0–100) using feature engineering across funding recency, job posting velocity, news mentions, and engineering activity
4. Surface actionable targets 
    — build a Streamlit dashboard with product analytics views (filters by stage, domain, score) to generate a weekly ranked outreach list
5. Track networking activity
     — embed a lightweight CRM log to record contacts, outreach status, and notes per company
6. Deliver weekly digests
     — automate a summary email of the top 10 highest-momentum startups each week using Python automation
7. Deploy to the cloud 
    — host on Render or Railway so the API integrations and scrapers run continuously without a local machine

 -did step one, crunchbase API is blocked, so I exported the 1,000 comapnies it will let you do at a time and went with that 
 -did step two, found job posting over time 
 -tried step 3, but the data it pulled was blank because small startups dont have news articles writen about them, shocker
 -stried step 4, tried to pull more chrunch base data with thier AI, whcih I knew from step 1 wouldent work, but I vide coded it 
 and AI doestn have the forsigth to say "this is bad idea". Tut tut tut. AI cant really think like a person, it just does what its told. 

 -------------------------------------

-Working on Requirment One
-tried step 5, the problem is it will need to add a parser to get the github links for each comapny,
    which would take an hour or so1
-This could have been done in step one by pulling it from cruncbase, same as step 4 (founders info)

So?
    -Clarfied project goals and scope, made promt, switch Claude CLT to planning mode...
    -yea that plan is way to complicated (detialed plan.md), at least I tried the tool
    -Made a new simpler list of chronolgical Project Requierments 
        -Added a data audting step to make find out what data soureces show promise BEFORE implementing
        -moved files for previoseu projects requiermens into new beta file, Step 1 and 2 can be repuprosed

    -predict what type of comapny a given Vc company investes based on thier protoflio,
    predcit which VC comapny? Domain? Based on each Vc predictor, rank cahnges of funding based on predicitors for diffeernt VC

Data Join
    -not needed, in step 4, features will be computed from each source seperatly 

------------------------------------------
2/22/2026

-started step 3
    -three dynamic data sources to try for now, JObSpy (done), SEC EDGAR (done), GDELT (pulled empty values, same as NewsAPI)
    -SEC EDGAR only pulled data for 29 companies, but in a a proget liek this we expect most data to be null becaue of how new the companies are, so that okays
    -turned of Claude CLI permission to accsess websites, this data is not confidental, just running on a local file

Dyamic data sources to try next 
    -Git Hub
    -SimilarWeb (low hit, high vlaue)
    -Tranco (low, hit high vlaue)

    Git Hub 
        -made a Git Token (works as apassword to Git hub account iwhtout actually sugin you password) for 90 days, dont sahre it becuase it sbsiacly a password
        -Now waiting for git hub to parse information, not sure how long it will take 
        -got 243 out of 871, not bad 
            -need to build it out to get more infor like repsository stars and what not

    Google_Trends 
        -worked pretty well
        -top ten results are prorably gerneric words that are the same as de fuzzed comapny names, flag  during feature enginnering 

okay, I think I pretty mutch finished step 3. Prorbaly will have to look for more dyanmci data and maybe update static data spine when my pull quote getes rensued from Crunchbase next mounth.
